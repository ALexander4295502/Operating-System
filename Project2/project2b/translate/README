Files updated:
<1> sys_translate:

	Makefile
	defs.h
	syscall.c
	syscall.h
	sysproc.c
	translate.c (for test)
	user.h
	usys.S
In the translate.c, we put a while(1) in the end of the file because we cannot just exit the program, once exit, the resource used by the program may be 
taken by OS, so we cannot see the correct result in the QEMU monitor.
The command to see the memory is x(for virtual memory) and xp(for physical memory).


<2> Null pointer exception

	Makefile
	exec.c
	vm.c
	nullptrtest.c (for test)
