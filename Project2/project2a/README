Strategy: First fit
Reason: Since first ﬁt has the advantage of speed — no exhaustive search of all the free spaces are necessary. 
Besides, since the test will allocate and free the memory in random, the question offragmentation
is not serious. So the main factor that influences the total time is search. But considering the memory 
utilization, we think that the first fit stategy is not feasible due to the internal fragmentation and external 
fragmentation, and buddy allocation is the best choice.
